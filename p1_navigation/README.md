### Introduction

This project is based on the Udacity DQN exercise and applied on the banana collection game. The state space with 37 dimensions output from the Unity environment is extracted and feed into the Deep Q-Learning algorithm to train an agent to collect as many yellow banana and avoid blue banana as much as possible.
